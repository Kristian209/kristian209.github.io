Finally completed this exploratory data analysis project. Hands down it was the hardest project
in the course so far. I learned a lot about data preparation, visualization and
even modeling with naive bayesian classifiers.

I worked with a lot of different libraries including pandas, seaborn, scikitlearn, numpy,
and matplotlib.

It was really challenging to complete the project but I was super addicted, I feel like
I learned a lot and I know next time I work on a similar project the workflow will be a
lot more fluid.

I highly recommend checking out the jupyter notebook I created using Google Colab.
You can find it on my github which I will link below.
