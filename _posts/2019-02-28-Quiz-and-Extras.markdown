I'm back!

I took a 2 week break from the data lit course but before I did I completed the
assigned quiz and scored a 100%.

I also completed the Trigonometry course on Khan Academy within the 2 week "break".
I wanted to fully complete the Trigonometry course before moving on to the statistics
course on Khan. I know math is an essential foundation for data science so I want to
make sure to brush up on it and learn more. Practice doesn't hurt.

I also started reading a data science book to broaden my understanding of the subject.
So far it has gone into detail about how data science came to be and how it has been
used so far.

I am exited to get back to data lit and look forward to sharing the journey on this
platform.
