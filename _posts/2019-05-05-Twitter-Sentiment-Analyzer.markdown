I had fun in this project. I already did most of the code(web scraping tweets
  on the keyword "Airpods") during part 1.2 of the course. All I had to do for
  this assignment was the visualization.

**Picking the visualization**
It took me a minute to think of possible
ways to visualize the data but I came up with doing a bar graph to easily see
which sentiment was expressed the most in the tweets.

Try it for yourself, the link to the jupyter notebook is in my github.
The tweets constantly change as it mines the most recent tweets.
