Hi Everyone!

The purpose of this post to detail where I am starting - my current skills,
my past experience and my ambitions.

I've always loved technology and loved video games as a teen. I was fortunate to
learn basic programming principals in high school including some HTML.

Out of high school I thought I would find the most growth getting out of my comfort
zone and took a lot of classes in art and theater. I did learn new ways to view
the world and grew a lot in areas such as communication, simply by learning about
human expression. I also got a job doing sales which accelerated the growth
exponentially. I worked for a great solar company doing sales, having the privilege
live with the owner of the company for close to half a year. Around this time I was
dabbling with computer programming again and found myself learning web development.
I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React from FreeCodeCamp. I did several projects
FreeCodeCamp made me do on CodePen which I later transferred to GitHub.

I have always been fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and when the school of ai
came out with a course on Reinforcement Learning I had to enroll! The course was
really advanced for me. I had no strong math skills and I was learning python at
the same time as taking the course. After around a month of going through the course
I knew it would be best for me to not only brush up on my math but to also learn
more advanced math that would help greatly in Machine Learning and Data Science.

Around this time I really debated whether or not to go back to school. I figured
I would try learning maths through Khan Academy and if I had to go back to school
then be it. I really do love the academics and would love to go back to school
after being more financially stable.(Having a data science job) I went through
the Trigonometry course in Khan Academy and currently going through Calculus.
I reignited my love for math! I study whenever and as much as possible because it
is something that not only fascinates me but I know will greatly help in the career
I want.

The school of ai recently came out with a new course, a more of a beginner friendly
course compared to the RL course. I enrolled and decided to make this blog to start
documenting what I learn going through it and more.
